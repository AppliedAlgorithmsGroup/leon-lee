/**
 * Created by Leon on 2/14/17.
 * Fibonacci Modified (https://www.hackerrank
 * .com/challenges/fibonacci-modified, Medium)
 *
 * We define a modified Fibonacci sequence using the following definition:
 *
 * Given terms t(i) and t(i+1) where i belongs to [1, infinite), term t(i+2) is
 * computed using the following relation:
 *     t(i+2) = t(i) + t(i+1)^2
 *
 * For example, if term t(1)=0 and t(2)=1, term t(3)=0+1^2=1, term t(4)=1+1^2=2,
 * term t(5)= 1+2^2=5, and so on.
 *
 * Given three integers,t(1), t(2), and n, compute and print term t(nï¼‰of a
 * modified Fibonacci sequence.
 *
 * Note: The value of t(n) may far exceed the range of a 64-bit integer. Many
 * submission languages have libraries that can handle such large results but,
 * for those that don't (e.g., C++), you will need to be more creative in your
 * solution to compensate for the limitations of your chosen submission language.
 *
 * Input Format:
 *
 * A single line of three space-separated integers describing the respective
 * values of t(1), t(2), and n.
 *
 * Constrains:
 *   0<=t(1), t(2)<=2
 *   3<= n <=20
 *   t(n) may far exceed the range of a 64-bit integer.
 *
 * Output Format:
 *
 * Print a single integer denoting the value of term t(n) in the modified
 * Fibonacci sequence where the first two terms are t(1) and t(2).
 *
 * Sample Input:
 *
 *   0 1 5
 *
 * Sample Outputs:
 *
 *   5
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The first two terms of the sequence are t(1)=0 and t(2) = 1, which gives
 * us a modified Fibonacci sequence of {0,1,1,2,5,27,...}. Because n=5, we
 * print term t(5), which is 5.
